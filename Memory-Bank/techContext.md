# Technical Context: FileDrive Implementation

## Frontend Architecture

### Component Structure

The application follows a modular component architecture:

- **Core Components**:
  - `FolderCard`: Displays folder with animation effects
  - `FileCard`: Displays file with hover actions
  - `StorageUsageBar`: Visualizes storage usage
  - `Sidebar`: Navigation and user info
  - `Breadcrumb`: Folder navigation
  - `DriveHeader`: Search and actions
  - `EmptyState`: Empty folder/file visualization

### State Management

- Currently using React's built-in state management (useState, useContext)
- Future consideration for more robust state management with Redux or Zustand

### Styling Approach

- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Component-specific styles defined in globals.css using @apply
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Primary color theme throughout the application

### Animation Strategy

- Using Framer Motion for animation effects
- Staggered animations for lists of items
- Hover/tap animations for interactive elements
- Transition animations for modals and state changes

## Backend Integration Points

### API Requirements

The frontend will need the following API endpoints:

1. **Authentication**:

   - User registration
   - Login/logout
   - Password reset

2. **File Operations**:

   - List files/folders
   - Upload file
   - Download file
   - Delete file
   - Create folder
   - Delete folder
   - Rename file/folder
   - Move file/folder

3. **Sharing**:

   - Share file/folder
   - List shared items
   - Manage permissions

4. **User Data**:
   - User profile
   - Storage usage

### Database Schema Implementation

Schema is designed with SQL in mind, with tables for:

- Users (id, name, email, storage)
- Files (id, name, type, size, owner)
- Folders (id, name, parent, owner)
- Shares (owner, shared_with, permission)

## Technical Debt & Considerations

### Current Limitations

- Mock data instead of actual API integration
- Limited error handling
- No real authentication flow
- Basic loading states

### Browser Compatibility

- Target browsers: Latest 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Mobile browser support: iOS Safari, Android Chrome

### Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading for file lists
- Virtualization for large file lists
- Image optimization for thumbnails
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed files

### Security Considerations

- CSRF protection for API requests
- Secure file upload validation
- Permission checks for file access
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
