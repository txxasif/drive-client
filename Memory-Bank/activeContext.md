# Active Context

## Current Focus

- **Context Menu Implementation**: Completing full functionality for right-click context menus, including operations like cut, copy, paste, and rename
- **File Browser Experience**: Fine-tuning the Ubuntu-like file browser experience with improved interactions
- **File Properties View**: Adding a detailed properties view for files and folders
- **Mobile Experience**: Creating touch-friendly alternatives to right-click functionality
- **UI Performance Optimization**: Improving rendering efficiency for large file lists

## Recent Changes

- Transformed the file browser into an Ubuntu-like interface with unified file/folder view
- Implemented right-click context menus for files and folders
- Added comprehensive sorting and filtering capabilities
- Created toggle between list and grid views
- Unified the UI with consistent file type handling
- Added ProgressBar and Dropzone components for file uploads
- Implemented proper TypeScript typing throughout the application
- Fixed various linting issues and improved code organization

## Current Issues

- Context menu positioning needs adjustment on certain screen sizes
- Mobile interactions need touch-friendly alternatives to right-click
- Large file lists may cause performance issues (consider virtualization)
- Folder navigation needs improvement for deeper hierarchies
- Need to complete implementation of context menu actions (cut, copy, paste)

## Next Immediate Steps

- Implement file properties/details view
- Add rename functionality for files and folders
- Create file preview component for different file types
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Add batch selection for multiple files/folders

## Active Considerations

- Balance between feature richness and performance
- Mobile-first approach with touch-friendly alternatives
- Accessibility as a core requirement, not an afterthought
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers
- Preparing for backend integration

## Development Approach

- Component-first development
- Mobile-responsive from the start
- Accessibility built-in, not added later
- Performance monitoring with each new feature
- Regular refactoring to maintain code quality

## Current Technical Decisions

- Using Framer Motion for animations and context menu interactions
- Implementing proper form validation with error messaging
- Using React Context API for state management
- Maintaining a consistent design system
- Following atomic design principles for components

## UI/UX Improvement Opportunities

## Next Steps

1. Implement file properties view with detailed metadata
2. Add rename functionality to context menu actions
3. Create preview component for different file types
4. Implement keyboard shortcuts for power users
5. Add batch selection and operations for multiple files
