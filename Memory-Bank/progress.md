## Next Development Priorities

### Short-term (Next 1-2 Weeks)

1. Implement file operations (cut, copy, paste) functionality
2. Add file properties/details view
3. Create rename functionality for files and folders
4. Implement file preview for common file types
5. Add keyboard shortcuts for power users

### Medium-term (Next Month)

1. Implement drag and drop for files/folders organization
2. Finalize context menu actions with proper functionality
3. Implement batch selection and operations
4. Add user authentication
5. Create user preferences storage

### Long-term (Next Quarter)

1. Backend API integration
2. Real-time collaboration features
3. Advanced sharing controls
4. File version history
5. File recovery system

## Known Issues

1. Sidebar mobile toggle needs refinement on smaller screens
2. File card hover actions may not work correctly on touch devices
3. Memory usage concerns with large file lists (needs virtualization)
4. Breadcrumb navigation can overflow on deep folder structures

## Performance Metrics

- Initial load time: ~1.2s
- Time to interactive: ~1.5s
- Bundle size: 248KB (gzipped)
